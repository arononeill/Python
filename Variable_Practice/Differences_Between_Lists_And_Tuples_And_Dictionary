Tuple Vs Lists Vs Dictionary:

TUPLE :-

- Is immutable which means, once made, it's values cannot change
- Is self-indexed exactly like an array list starting at index 0.
- Are more explicit with memory
- Declared using () brackets 

example of declaration is as follows:
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") 

LISTS :-

- Extremely similar to tuples except that lists are mutable, meaning they can be changed
- Require overhead, more memory.
- Declared using [] brackets 

example of declaration is as follows:
list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]

DICTIONARY :-

- Consist of key-value pairs
- Are kind of hash table type
- Declared using {} brackets 

example of declaration is as follows:
thisdict =	{
  "apple": "green",
  "banana": "yellow",
  "cherry": "red"
}
